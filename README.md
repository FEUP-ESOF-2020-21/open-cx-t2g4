## Product Vision
Bring everyone to the conference sessions! Let the deaf hear and the mute speak.

---
## Elevator Pitch
In every conference there are two main elements: to listen and to see. But the former is not always possible due to hearing loss.  
The interaction between the audience and the speaker makes conferences alive, that's why whe created **Com4All**.

The **Com4All** is an app that enables communication, allowing one to keep track of the session through a real-time transcription of what is being said.  

This solution's main advantages are that it is free and open-source, in addiction to being simple, fast, and light resource- and data-wise.

### Domain model

![Domain Model](images/domain-model.svg)

Our app consists of Users(Atendee or Speaker) and its devices, Conferences and Messages.  
Both Atendees and Speakers are Users. Each user has its own device. 
Each Conference has one speaker and multiple atendees who can send messages related to a conference such as questions. One message can only be sent by one device/user(only atendees can send messages) and can only target one conference. Each conference has a transcript which is updated by the Speaker responsible for the conference.

## Architecture and Design
The architecture of a software system encompasses the set of key decisions about its overall organization. 

A well written architecture document is brief but reduces the amount of time it takes new programmers to a project to understand the code to feel able to make modifications and enhancements.

To document the architecture requires describing the decomposition of the system in their parts (high-level components) and the key behaviors and collaborations between them. 

In this section you should start by briefly describing the overall components of the project and their interrelations. You should also describe how you solved typical problems you may have encountered, pointing to well-known architectural and design patterns, if applicable.

### Logical architecture
The purpose of this subsection is to document the high-level logical structure of the code, using a UML diagram with logical packages, without the worry of allocating to components, processes or machines.

It can be beneficial to present the system both in a horizontal or vertical decomposition:
* horizontal decomposition may define layers and implementation concepts, such as the user interface, business logic and concepts; 
* vertical decomposition can define a hierarchy of subsystems that cover all layers of implementation.

### Physical architecture

![Physical architecture](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1rgcc0jQ3XAd2BTVOjhjPFrYSpomnKoAa)

In this project we used the Flutter framework, following the suggestion of the professors, as it have many built-in features and public packages. For the dependencies we used [speech_to_text](https://pub.dev/packages/speech_to_text) in the transcriber and [flutter_tts](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_tts) fot the text to speech feature. We also opted for Firebase for our database server because of its simple setup. The Com4All app connects with the database everytime it needs to send or receive messages.

### Prototype

To help on validating all the architectural, design and technological decisions made, we implemented a thin vertical slice of the system.

We created a structure where we could verify the possibility of the two main features: transcription and question synthesizing. Both were implemented locally and we could test which modules were more suitable for this purposes.

---

## Implementation

Changelogs for the 4 different product increments can be found [here](https://github.com/FEUP-ESOF-2020-21/open-cx-t2g4-bits-please/releases)

---
## Test

To ensure the quality of the application, we performed automated tests with Flutter Gherkin.

The features tested are:
* [Joining a session](https://github.com/FEUP-ESOF-2020-21/open-cx-t2g4-bits-please/blob/main/src/test_driver/features/join_session.feature)
* [Asking a question](https://github.com/FEUP-ESOF-2020-21/open-cx-t2g4-bits-please/blob/main/src/test_driver/features/ask_question.feature)

In this section it is only expected to include the following:
* test plan describing the list of features to be tested and the testing methods and tools;
* test case specifications to verify the functionalities, using unit tests and acceptance tests.
 
A good practice is to simplify this, avoiding repetitions, and automating the testing actions as much as possible.

---
## Configuration and change management

In order to maintain the integrity of our project's artifacts, configuration and change management are key activities.

To manage feature requests, bug fixes, and improvements, we used GitHub issues following the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).

## Project management

### User Story Map
